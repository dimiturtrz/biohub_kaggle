One-line description of celltrack. (Replace me.)

## Layout

- `core/`, `celltrack/` — your packages. The guardrails target all of them; organise modules however the project needs.
- `tests/` — `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/`.
- `devtools/` — the guardrail tools (`graph.py` arch-fitness, plus the class-shape explorers).

The set of packages the gates lint/test/graph is the `packages` answer (comma-separated) — add more
without touching any gate file; every gate renders over the list. Directional layer contracts between
packages are **opt-in** (add import-linter yourself — see `devtools/README.md`), never imposed.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimiturtrz/biohub_kaggle
uv sync --extra dev --extra devtools
nox -s lint test cov
```

## Gates

`nox -s lint test cov` (or `nox -s gates`) runs exactly what CI runs:

- **lint** — ruff check (pinned) + ruff format --check (advisory) + vulture + arch-fitness (`graph.py --assert`) + ast-grep + jscpd.
- **test** — pytest.
- **cov** — pytest --cov with a `--fail-under=90` floor.

## Architecture site

`nox -s archmap` writes `docs/architecture/graph.json` (committed, diffable — nodes + weighted import edges)
plus a self-contained interactive viewer (`index.html`, gitignored, rebuilt on demand). **Commit the
graph.json diff** — it's the architecture-erosion record.

▶ **Live viewer: [https://dimiturtrz.github.io/biohub_kaggle/architecture/](https://dimiturtrz.github.io/biohub_kaggle/architecture/)** — main; dev preview at [https://dimiturtrz.github.io/biohub_kaggle/architecture/preview/](https://dimiturtrz.github.io/biohub_kaggle/architecture/preview/)


Publishing to GitHub Pages — one repo = one Pages site, so pick ONE of:

- **Sole owner** — this repo has no other Pages deployer. Answer `archviz_pages` yes at scaffold time; the
  generated `pages.yml` owns a staged site (`/architecture/` = main, `/architecture/preview/` = dev, `/`
  redirects) and enables it. Nothing else to do.
- **Compose** — this repo ALREADY deploys Pages (a docs/demo site). Leave `archviz_pages` off and fold the
  archmap build into that existing workflow as an `/architecture/` subpath. Build it isolated (no project
  sync, no touch to the pinned devtools) — `write_viewer` only needs the vendored template + libs:

  ```yaml
  - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
  - name: Architecture view (/architecture/)
    run: |
      uv run --no-project --with "sdlc-devtools @ git+https://github.com/dimiturtrz/sdlc-scaffold.git@v1.26.0#subdirectory=sdlc-devtools" \
        python -c "from devtools.graph.archmap import Archmap; Archmap(['core', 'celltrack']).write_viewer(project='celltrack')"
      mkdir -p _site/architecture
      cp docs/architecture/graph.json docs/architecture/index.html _site/architecture/
  ```

  graph.json stays committed (the diff-truth); regen it locally with `nox -s archmap` when the import
  structure changes. (`../synthscape` is the reference — archmap folded into its `deploy-fit-explorer`
  workflow beside the fit-explorer views.)

## Development

Tooling + quality gates are provisioned by an in-house copier template (**sdlc-scaffold**). Refresh with
`uvx copier update`; `.copier-answers.yml` pins the template version.

### Local hooks

The same gates CI enforces are bound to git events via pre-commit. Install **both** stages:

```bash
pre-commit install                        # commit stage — fast static gates (ruff/vulture/arch-fitness/…)
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push   # push stage — fast unit suite (tests/unit)
```

The pre-push hook runs `pytest tests/unit` so a change that lints clean but breaks a test **contract** (a
signature change a mirror test still calls the old way) is caught before the push, not after CI goes red. It
is deliberately push-only (not every commit) and unit-only (no integration/e2e); the coverage floor stays a
CI job. The default `pre-commit install` does **not** wire pre-push — run the second line once per clone.
